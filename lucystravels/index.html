                        Travel has become remarkably affordable in the past decade. With the growth of more and more
                        budget
                        friendly airlines, we’ve seen a huge travel boom. There’s a lot more competitive pricing when it
                        comes
                        to finding tickets, and if you’re willing to be flexible about when and where you go, there’s
                        always
                        an
                        affordable option!
                        If you have a specific destination in mind, waiting for the right opportunity to arise can be
                        the
                        biggest game changer in how much you spend on flights. Another aspect to look at is not only the
                        cost of
                        travel, but how much you’ll spend on lodging and food. This has made travel a lot easier and a
                        lot
                        more
                        family friendly.
                        Sometimes you will spend more on lodging than on the actual ticket getting to your destination.
                        These
                        are all good things to keep in mind when planning your first trip.
