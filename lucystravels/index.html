                Read more about how I got started below —>

                Travel has become remarkably affordable in the past decade. With the growth of more and more budget
                friendly airlines, we’ve seen a huge travel boom. There’s a lot more competitive pricing when it comes
                to finding tickets, and if you’re willing to be flexible about when and where you go, there’s always an
                affordable option!
                If you have a specific destination in mind, waiting for the right opportunity to arise can be the
                biggest game changer in how much you spend on flights. Another aspect to look at is not only the cost of
                travel, but how much you’ll spend on lodging and food. This has made travel a lot easier and a lot more
                family friendly.
                Sometimes you will spend more on lodging than on the actual ticket getting to your destination. These
                are all good things to keep in mind when planning your first trip.

                and is an iconic landmark to the country. - 2015

            <h2>On the trail to Everest Base Camp - We started out in a lush, green, and humid climate, but as we got

            <h3>
                At the age of 15 I had never even left my home state of Utah, I hadn’t even traveled more than 5 hours
                away from my house! Travel seemed like a completely foreign concept and something that only a select few
                had the opportunity to experience.
                In 2015 that perspective drastically changed when my family had the opportunity to visit Nepal. We
                decided to jump on the chance and take the trip. At first it was a very scary experience, I hadn’t even
                been to another state before, let alone a 3rd world country in Asia.
                Traveling to Nepal for the first time allowed me to experience what it was like to travel
                internationally. As well as HOW to travel internationally.
                We had an amazing trip full of wonderful experiences. After that, I haven’t been able to stop traveling!

            <h2>Everest Base Camp - 2017</h2>
            <h3>In September of 2017 we decided to go back to Nepal to hike to Everest Base camp. The trek was 2 weeks
                to base camp, and 1 week home.
                While visiting the country we got to stay in the capital city Kathmandu, where we got to experience
                different foods, languages, religions, and met so many different people.
                This trek not only included your typical air travel and taxi rides, but traveling on foot as well.


                Ever since then I’ve been looking into different flights, deals, and countries to visit. There has been
                a lot of trial and error along the way, but with that came a lot of learning.

            <h2>Paris - 2021</h2>
            <h3>In the summer of 2021 I decided to take a trip to Paris. This was just after the closures from Covid-19
                were coming to an end, and it was a great time to travel!
                I don’t think I’d ever been to such a historically rich and beautiful city before, I absolutely fell in
                love (especially with the food)
                I got to spend 3 days exploring the Louvre. Seeing the Mona Lisa and other works of art opened my eyes
                to preserving the art that we have today.
