            Depending on where you're coming from, traveling out of state or out of country for the first time can be
            very intimidating. Even if it’s not your the native language, there are always people and signs around to
            help
            you navigate your new adventure.
            Whether you’re wanting to go to the farthest reaches or Asia, or to our northern neighbors in Canada,
            traveling away from home doesn’t have to be a scary experience.
        </h2>
        <h3>Traveling for the first time is a unique and transformative experience! While sometimes foreign and new,
            visiting a country you haven’t been to before can be a huge milestone in your life. Traveling solo can be
            fun, and is an adventure all on its own. However, I’d highly recommend taking a friend or family member with
            you the first time you hop on a flight out of the states.
            Traveling with a friend offers a lot more safety, help, (and if they’ve traveled before) guidance.

            Embarking on your first journey will open a door of self discovery and exploration.
            The thrill of navigating new landscapes, trying new foods, meeting new people, and immersing yourself into a
            new culture will create memories that will last a lifetime.

            First time travel sparks a sense of independence and resilience in the face of unexpected challenges that
            may arise. There’s always an adventure to be had!

                <h2>Witness the world with fresh eyes and take your first trip as an opportunity to step outside of your
                    comfort zone, and witness the world with fresh eyes.
                    I think you’ll come to find that as you embark on your first journey that you’ll enjoy the
                    experience of travel itself and not just the destination.
