                <p>Not sure where to start? No problem! Follow our simple guide to when and where you want to take your
                    first trip! Book on cheaper days
                    Scan for booking errors
                    Be flexible with your departure dates.
                    Invest in travel insurance to cover unexpected events such as trip cancellations, medical
                    emergencies, or lost luggage.
                    Understand that not everything will go as planned, and that's okay. Embracing uncertainty is part of
                    the adventure, and often, the best experiences come from unexpected moments
                    *Hint: Always search for flights incognito, that way your cookies aren’t tracking your travel dates
                    and
                    prices.
                    The prices you’re seeing will stay constant instead of gradually going up!</p>

                    challenges contribute to personal growth and development.
